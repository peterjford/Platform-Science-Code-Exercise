  no malformed input means 
    the files exist
    the addresses in the addresses file are in this format:
        123 Street Name\n
        456 Other Street Name Ave.\n
    the drivers names in the drivers file are in this format:
        Firstname Lastname\n
        Bob James Driver\n
  the number of drivers is >= the number addresses
  spaces count as characters in lengths of street names
  characters are ascii
  y is not a vowel

  Another assumption is that abbreviations will not be expanded for driver and address lengths

  Lakeview St.

code to input filenames

code read file
  driver file: read driver names into an array
  address file: strip out numbers at begining of address line put into an array
  
function to count characters to determind odd or even (address) easier just to return the mod //{ if (length(address) % 2) { return odd } return even }
function to count vowels (drivers_name) { foreach (str_split($drivers_name) as $char) { if strtoupper($char) === ('A' || 'E' || 'I' || 'O' || 'U') {
  vowel_count++}} return vowel_count}
function to count constonants (drivers_name) {return (length(drivers_name = str_replace(' ', '', drivers_name)) - vowels(drivers_name)); }
funciton to check for common factors
ss =0
outer loop addresses i
inner loop drivers j

if address[i] = even {ss = vowels_in_name(driver_name[j]) x 1.5 }
else {ss = length(driver_name[j]) - vowels_in_name(driver_name[j] }

if common_factors(drivers_name[j], address[i]) {ss = ss * .5 }

// if new ss > ss in assigne pairs array, add driver and ss to assigned pairs array, remove driver from drivers array
end of inner loop drivers ss for each address
remove address

end of outer loop

have to get the scores for all drivers for all addresses first, then sort.  Not just get the highest score in order
since  driver could have to highest score for 2 different addreses.  So then you would sort by SS.

display names and assigned addresses.
