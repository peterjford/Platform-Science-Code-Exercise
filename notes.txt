language: PHP CLI

  no malformed input means 
    the files exist
    the addresses in the addresses file are in this format:
        123 Street Name\n
        456 Other Street Name Ave.\n
    the drivers names in the drivers file are in this format:
        Firstname Lastname\n
        Bob James Driver\n
  the number of drivers is >= the number addresses
  spaces count as characters in lengths of street names
  characters are ascii
  y is not a vowel

code to input filenames

code read file
  driver file: read driver names into an array
  address file: strip out numbers at begining of address line put into an array
  
function to count characters to determind odd or even (address) { if (length(address) % 2) { return odd } return even }
function to count vowels (drivers_name) { foreach (str_split($drivers_name) as $char) { if strtoupper($char) === ('A' || 'E' || 'I' || 'O' || 'U') {
  vowel_count++}} return vowel_count}
function to count constonants (drivers_name) {return (length(drivers_name = str_replace(' ', '', drivers_name)) - vowels(drivers_name)); }
funciton to check for common factors

outer loop addresses i
inner loop drivers j
ss = 0;
if address[i] = even {ss = vowels_in_name(driver_name[j]) x 1.5 }
else {ss = length(driver_name[j]) - vowels_in_name(driver_name[j] }

if common_factors(drivers_name[j], address[i]) {ss = ss * .5 }

end of inner loop drivers ss for each address
select highest ss, add to assigned pairs array, remove address and drivers name

end of outer loop

display names and assigned addresses.
