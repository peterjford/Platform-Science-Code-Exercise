Instructions for use of the assign_shipments.php application.

This is a PHP command line application.  It uses PHP CLI and was tested using PHP 7.1.23 (cli).

Once you have pulled the code from the github repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/peterjford/Platform-Science-Code-Exercise.git

Change into the Platform-Science-Code-Exercise directory:
$ cd Platform-Science-Code-Exercise/

Inside that directory are all the files needed to run the application, plus a few sample files used for testing:
$ ls -1
README.md
assign_shipments.php
code_exercise
driver_roster
driver_roster.2
functions.php
instructions.txt
notes.txt
shipments.2023-01-13.txt
shipments.2023-01-16.txt
ss_modifiers.php

To run the applicaton simply type ./ then the applcation name "assign_shipments.php" followed by the filename for the shipments, then the filename for the drivers:
$ ./assign_shipments.php shipments.2023-01-13.txt driver_roster

The files for the shipments and drivers must be in that order.

The application will output the names of the files used, followed by a listing of the assignments to the drivers: 
$ ./assign_shipments.php shipments.2023-01-16.txt driver_roster
address filename: shipments.2023-01-16.txt
drivers filename : driver_roster
Driver Mario Andretti is assigned to shipment at address 1313 Harbour Ave. with a SS of 13.5.
Driver Billy Bob Driver is assigned to shipment at address 1 B with a SS of 10.
Driver Mack Trucker is assigned to shipment at address 1243 Backer St. with a SS of 6.75.
Driver Al Unser Jr. is assigned to shipment at address 123 Main with a SS of 6.75.

The applcation will also create a file (assuming you have write permission to the directory you are running the application in) with a filename of "Driver Assignments.YYYY-MM-DD.txt"

You can also run the file in the PHP cli console: 
$ php -f assign_shipments.php shipments.2023-01-16.txt driver_roster
